ChartZ!
===================

### See everything.

Have you ever run exploratory data analysis before and wondered "Hmmm would be cool to view all the charts at the same time without scrolling or changing tab". 

Well I had for sure and I have good news!  That's exactly why this package was created. ChartZ! is the remedy for all of us who are not able to memorize insights from the chart you have seen 5 seconds ago. 

Solution to our struggles is so obvious - just have all the charts visible at once. Quite simple, right?

Here, have a screenshot to get you excited (I am aware of the fact that UI still looks scuffed):
